# Fall 2018 Reionization

This is the main repository for Chenxiao's fall 2018 research project focusing on reionization.

## Prof. Hirata's suggestion on relevant papers:

Hirata (2018):
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03358.pdf
Read Appendix A for the description of the model of an ionization front.

Some related background:

Miralda-Escudé & Rees (1994):
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994MNRAS.266..343M
This is the “classic” paper on how reionization heated the IGM, and it has many insights that remain relevant today (although be warned that some of the ideas are outdated).

D’Aloisio et al. (2018):
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09282.pdf
You mainly need to look at Appendix B, which contains some comments on thermal ionization timescales. They show that thermalization occurs later in the ionization front (where x_i~0.5) but is not expected to occur in the leading part of the front (small x_i, where much of the photoionization energy is injected). It is not clear without a more detailed calculation what the consequences of this will be.

## Remarks and questions
1. Ionization front grid stucture

2. Frequency bins

3. I am using the standard flag "cc -std=c99 -Wall" for compilation

4. Running command (e.g.): ./gif 50000 500000000
